# Code Style and Standards Guides

Coding standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, programming styles, and conventions that developers follow when writing source code for a project. Developers should adhere to these standards to achieve various objectives, including:

- Maintaining code maintainability
- Ensuring code transparency, sanity, and readability
- Facilitating code scalability

In projects governed by a style guide, developers must learn, understand, and consistently implement the guide. Any deviation from the guide should be thoroughly justified.

While consistency is crucial, it's also essential to recognize when inconsistency may be necessaryâ€”sometimes, the style guide may not apply to a particular situation.

The guiding principle is straightforward: prioritize readability over strict adherence to rules.
