# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Homelab-Alpha, we prioritize the security and integrity of our repositorys. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or issues within our Template repository, please promptly report them to Homelab-Alpha by [creating a new issue]. Your assistance in identifying and resolving potential security risks is greatly appreciated.

## Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security updates for the following versions:

- The latest stable release
- The previous stable release (if applicable)

To ensure the continued security, we strongly advise utilizing one of these supported versions and promptly applying any available security patches and updates.

## Third-Party Dependencies

Our repositorys may utilize third-party components and dependencies beyond our direct control. While we strive to maintain the integrity and security of these dependencies, we cannot guarantee their absolute safety. Users are encouraged to conduct their own thorough assessments of any third-party.

## Limitation of Liability

By utilizing our repositorys, you expressly acknowledge and agree that Homelab-Alpha and its contributors shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or security breaches arising from the use of our repositorys or related components. This includes, but is not limited to, any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, as well as any loss of profits, data, or business opportunities.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Homelab-Alpha and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to your use of our repositorys, including but not limited to any breaches of security, violations of applicable laws or regulations, or infringement of third-party rights.

## Security Best Practices

In addition to the aforementioned policies, we strongly recommend adhering to the following security best practices when utilizing our repositorys:

"ADD_TEXT_HERE"

By following these best practices, you can help enhance the security of your "CHANGE_ME" deployments and minimize the risk of security breaches or unauthorized access. If you need further assistance or have specific security concerns, don't hesitate to reach out for help or guidance!

Feel free to modify and adapt this security policy to align with the specific requirements and legal considerations of your organization. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out!
